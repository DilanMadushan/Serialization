# Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted, and then reconstructing it back into an object when needed. It allows objects to be saved to disk, sent over a network, or stored in a database.

There are various serialization techniques and formats available, such as JSON, XML, and binary serialization. Each has its own advantages and use cases.

When serializing an object, it is important to consider factors like data size, performance, and compatibility with different programming languages or platforms. Additionally, security measures should be taken to prevent unauthorized access or tampering of serialized data.

In this repository, we explore different serialization techniques and provide examples and best practices for implementing serialization in various programming languages.

Feel free to explore the code samples and documentation provided here to learn more about serialization and how to effectively use it in your projects.
